    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python and nearly all of the software packages in the scientific python\n",
    "ecosystem are [open-source](https://opensource.org/).\n",
    "They are maintained and developed by a community of scientists and programmers,\n",
    "some of whose work is supported by universities, non-profits, and for-profit\n",
    "corporations.\n",
    "This work mostly happens in the open, via [github](http://github.com/) and other\n",
    "online collaboration platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no single authority which controls all of these packages, it\n",
    "can be intimidating for new users to figure out how to set up a functional\n",
    "scientific python environment.\n",
    "Coordinating the compatibility between these different packages and their\n",
    "multiple versions used to be a nightmare!\n",
    "Fortunately, the problem is solved completely by using a Python _distribution_\n",
    "and / or a Python _package manager_ (described in detail below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The only hard-and-fast rule about scientific computing in Python is this:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition}  Do not use your system Python installation!\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "The version of Python that ships with operating systems such as Red Hat Linux and\n",
    "macOS is usually outdated and configured to support system functions. Although it\n",
    "is entirely possible to install and use the necessary packages using the system\n",
    "Python, it's much more practical on both\n",
    "your local machine and any other computers you work with to use a specialised Python\n",

    "[now support only Python 3](http://www.python3statement.org/) in the\n",
    "near future without any backwards compatibility. The differences between\n",
    "Python 2 and Python 3 are mostly superficial, but large enough that it is\n",
    "cumbersome to maintain large codebases that are compatible with both. With the\n",
    "exception of a handful of packages you may encounter which do not support\n",
    "Python 3, there is no compelling reason to use Python 2 today.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Installation Method: Use Anaconda Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to set up a full-stack scientific Python deployment is to use a\n",
    "Python distribution. This is an installation of Python with a set of curated\n",
    "packages which are guaranteed to work together.\n",
    "For this class, I recommend the\n",
    "**[Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)**.\n",
    "Follow the link above to obtain a one-click installer for Linux, Mac, or\n",
    "Windows.\n",
    "(Make sure you select the Python 3 installer)\n",
    "In addition to the packages themselves, Anaconda includes a graphical\n",
    "utility to help manage any packages you may want to install which are not\n",
    "already included in the default inclusion list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes assume you have access to a Unix command line to type in shell commands.\n",
    "For Linux and MacOS users, you can access the command line by opening the _terminal_ program.\n",
    "It's more difficult for Windows users.\n",
    "For Windows users, you should first install Anaconda (described above) or Miniconda (described below), which gives you access to the \"Anaconda Prompt\" desktop app.\n",
    "(Instructions for this are given on the [Andaconda Website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#write-a-python-program-using-anaconda-prompt-or-terminal).)\n",
    "From the Anaconda Prompt, you should be able to run `conda` and other shell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lightweight Alternative: Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are installing python on a remote machine via ssh, or you simply don't\n",
    "want to download a huge file like the Anaconda Python Distribution, there is a\n",
    "lightweight alternative installation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain a minimal Python installer**\n",
    "  We recommend the [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installer;\n",
    "  this provides a Python install for your operating system, plus the **conda**\n",
    "  package manager. This way, you can only install the packages you *want*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the installer**\n",
    "  You'll probably need to do this from the command line, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "  Follow the instructions; you can choose where to place the installation (\n",
    "  preferably somewhere you have write access without super-user/root access,\n",
    "  like your home directory). At the end of this process, add this path to your\n",
    "  \\*rc configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ echo \". $HOME/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" > ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you do this, your ``$PYTHONPATH`` will be implicitly configured correctly\n",
    "  and you will never have to touch it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create the course environment and install packages.**\n",
    "  This is described in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing Environments with Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Python coupled with a package manager provides a way to make isolated,\n",
    "reproducible *environments* where you have fine-tuned control over all packages\n",
    "and configuration. **You should always work within an environment**, rather\n",
    "than the \"default\" environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly recommended to read official\n",
    "[Getting Started with Conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html#)\n",
    "guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a conda environment, you execute the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda create --name my_environment python=3.7 numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a special environment in ``$MINICONDA_HOME/envs/my_environment``\n",
    "with only Python and numpy to begin with. Here, we've also told conda to install\n",
    "Python version 3.7; you can specify exact versions or minima, and conda will\n",
    "take care of figuring out all the compatibilties between versions for you. To use\n",
    "this environment, simply \"activate\" it by executing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda activate my_environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of your shell, you should now see the string ``(my_environment)``\n",
    "prepended to your prompt. Now, if you execute any Python-related tool from the\n",
    "command line, it will first search in ``$MINICONDA_HOME/envs/my_environment/bin``\n",
    "to find them. You can deactivate your environment by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda deactivate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To see all the environments on your system:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda info --envs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to permanently remove an environment and delete all the data\n",
    "associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda remove --name my_environment --all\n",
    "\n",
    "For extensive documentation on using environments, please see\n",
    "[the conda documentation](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html). The most\n",
    "important feature to review here is the ability to *share and export* your\n",
    "environment; this is the basis for reproducibility in the scientific Python stack.\n",
    "At any time from the shell, you can execute\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda list\n",
    "\n",
    "to get a complete summary of all the packages installed in your environment, the\n",
    "channel they were installed from, and their full version info. Using this info,\n",
    "you can create an **environment file** in\n",
    "[YAML syntax](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/YAMLSyntax.html)\n",
    "which documents the exact\n",
    "contents of your environment. With that file, a new environment with the exact\n",
    "configuration can be installed by executing\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda env create -f my_environment.yml\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Python Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all of the previous sections, we can very easily spin-up a\n",
    "full-featured scientific Python environment with a set of packages curated for the\n",

    "and link for use in the environment a configuration which should be to play\n",
    "nicely and work with all of its components.)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installing More Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a basic Python environment, you can easily add or remove packages\n",
    "using the [conda](https://conda.io/) command line utility.\n",
    "Conda was created to help manage the complex dependencies and\n",
    "pre-compiled binary libraries that are necessary in scientific python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set up your python environment using the Anaconda Python Distribution or\n",
    "with miniconda, you should already have the **conda** command available on\n",
    "the command line.\n",
    "With it, you can easily install packages from an official, curated set of packages which are\n",
    "built and tested for a number of different system configurations on Linux,\n",
    "Windows, and macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda install <package-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is a\n",
    "community-maintained collection of packages/recipes called\n",
    "[conda forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/>)\n",
    "which is accessible through conda as a special \"channel\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda install -c conda-forge <package-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "While conda allows you to install almost any science-related package, there may\n",
    "be other general-use python packages you wish to you that are not available in\n",
    "via conda. For these, you can use an alternative installation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the scientific python community,\n",
    "the most common way to install packages is to search for them on the official\n",
    "[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) index. Once you've found the package you\n",
    "want to install (you may have also just found it on github or elsewhere), you\n",
    "use the **pip** command from a the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip install <package-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will fetch the source code, build it, and install it to wherever your\n",
    "``$PYTHONPATH`` is set. This works in the vast majority of cases, particularly\n",
    "when the code you're installing doesn't have any compiled dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you\n",
    "can't find a package on either PyPI or conda-forge, you can always install it\n",
    "directly from the source code. If the package is on github, ``pip`` already has\n",
    "an alias to do this for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip install git+https://github.com/<user>/<package-name>.git\n",
    "\n",
    "If all else fails, you can always download the source code and install it manually\n",
    "like\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ wget https:/path/to/my/pkg/source.tar.gz\n",
    "    $ tar -xvzf source.tar.gz\n",
    "    $ cd source/\n",
    "    $ python setup.py install\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use ``pip`` to install code you've downloaded:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ cd source/\n",
    "    $ pip install -e .\n",
    "\n",
    "This will automatically call **setup.py** for you. The \"**-e**\" flag will\n",
    "install the package in \"editable\" mode, which means that any change you make\n",
    "to the source code will automatically be recognised when you load the package\n",
    "in Python; this is *especially* useful when you're developing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you don't *have* to go through this process of installing packages. If you\n",
    "have code sitting on your disk somewhere, you can always modify the environmental\n",
    "variable ``$PYTHONPATH`` to include a path to that code, and Python will find it\n",
    "for you. However, you *should not do this* if it can be avoided, because it is\n",
    "extremely difficult (if not impossible) to be sure that any compiled code will\n",
    "link against the correct libraries it needs, and it is very hard to debug errors\n",
    "associated with mis-matched libraries/headers if you go this route."
